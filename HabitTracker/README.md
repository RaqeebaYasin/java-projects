# 📅 Habit Tracker (Java)

A **console-based Habit Tracker** built with **Java** that helps users develop consistency, track daily progress, and visualize habit streaks dynamically.  
It promotes discipline and productivity by reminding users about pending habits and automatically calculating consecutive-day streaks using real calendar dates.

- ✅ Mark habits as completed for the current day  
- 🔥 View ongoing streaks and completion history  
- 📅 Get reminders for habits not completed today  
- 🧮 Real-time date tracking using `java.time.LocalDate`

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — classes, objects, encapsulation  
- **Collections Framework** — dynamic lists using `ArrayList`  
- **Date and Time API** — handled via `LocalDate` and `DateTimeFormatter`  
- **Input Handling** — managed via `Scanner`  
- **Sorting, Loops, and Conditional Logic**  
- **Code Reusability** — structured modular design
